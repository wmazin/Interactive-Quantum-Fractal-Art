# Interactive Quantum Fractal Art

<br />
Repo for the RCOS project to create a widget for the Interactive Quantum Art Station.

<br />
<br />
The task is to create a simple widget, whereby when a user moves a vector around the Bloch sphere, 
different fractal images can be seen. This will help the user visualise what a quantum state might look 
like â€“ a notoriously difficult concept to visualise!
